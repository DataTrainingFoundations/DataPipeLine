Questions:
1. Has the NFL truly become more pass-heavy over time?
        Follow Ups:
        - When did the league significantly shift toward passing?
        - Where there any rule changes to influence this?

        Graphs:
        - Line Graph showing avg number of pass attempts vs rush attempts

2. Does passing efficiency correlate more strongly with winning than rushing?
        Graphs:
        - Scatter plot with pass attempt %(pass attempts / total plays) vs Win percentage
            - Color code playoff teams
        - Scatter plot with pass efficiency(pass yards / pass attempts) vs rush efficiency(rush yards / rush attempts)
            - Make bubbles different sizes on win %

3. Do Super Bowl teams lean pass or run?

4. Is rushing still important in the playoffs?
        Follow ups:
        - Do playoff teams lean more balanced?
        Graphs:
        - Bar chart avg pass % vs avg rush % for playoff vs non-playoff teams

5. Does balance (run/pass ratio) outperform extremes?
        Follow ups:
        - Is the league conerging towards similar offensive styles?
        Graphs:
        - Histogram of pass % by year

6. Do elite offenses rely more on efficiency or volume?
        Follow ups:
        - What matters more throwing more or throwing better?
        Graphs:
        - Scatter plot with pass attempts vs wins
        - Scatter plot with pass yards per attempt vs wins

7. Are bad teams run-heavy because they’re losing, or vice versa?

Other questions we could possibly answer but would need more data:
- Do teams rush more if they are winning?

Other graphs that could be useful:
- Pass TD rate vs Rush TD rate vs Wins
- Correlation matrix between pass attempts, rush attempts, yards per pass, yards per rush, wins

What we need to get/calculate:
- GET: team wins, playoff teams
- CALCULATE: pass %(pass attempts / pass + rush attempts), rush %(rush attempts / pass + rush attempts), 
yards per pass(pass yards / pass attempts), yards per rush(rush yards / rush attempts), 
win %(wins / wins + losses)
- AVERAGES: pass attempts, rush attempts, pass yards, rush yards
- Make team_id column for feature engineering

What we could conclude:
- The league has gotten more pass heavy
- Efficiency is more important than volume
- Balance and efficiency correlate to wins
- Modern NFL = efficiency-driven passing league
